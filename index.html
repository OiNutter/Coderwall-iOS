<h2>
<a name="the-app" class="anchor" href="#the-app"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The App</h2>

<p>Coderwall-iOS is an app for iPhone and iPad that lets you browse your
<a href="http://coderwall.com">Coderwall</a> profile. You can browse you list of
badges, your accomplishments and your stats and specialities, and even
search for other users.</p>

<h2>
<a name="why-is-it-open-source" class="anchor" href="#why-is-it-open-source"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why is it Open Source?</h2>

<p>I'm putting the app on the App Store for free as it's making use of
Coderwall, a free service, which itself is taking advantage of GitHub,
a huge promoter of Open Source, and free for public use, so it seemed
somewhat against the spirit of the thing to try and charge for it. In
addition it's my first app and is really just a bit of fun. </p>

<p>As for why I'm making it available on GitHub, like I said, it was my first app and
was something of a learning experience. I'm putting it here for 2
reasons.</p>

<ul>
<li>I hope that it will help other people trying to get into iOS
development, that they'll be able to learn from the things I had to do
to make things work the way I wanted them to.</li>
<li>I hope that people with more knowledge and experience when it comes to
iOS and Objective C will maybe get involved, and offer improvements
and tips so I can learn more for future projects.</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="a-note-on-copying" class="anchor" href="#a-note-on-copying"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>A Note On Copying</h3>

<p>I realise the risk with putting this code online is that someone else
could just take it and publish their own version, they could even charge
for it. I also realise there's probably not a lot I can do about that
short of making it private, which I don't want to do. All I can hope to
do is say if you want to add new features or improvements, please get
involved and support this app, submit pull requests and bug reports etc
and lets try and have one really good Coderwall app, instead of several
average ones.</p>

<h2>
<a name="coming-soon" class="anchor" href="#coming-soon"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Coming Soon</h2>

<p>At the moment the app is read only and doesn't take advantage of some of
the new features Coderwall has been adding, such as Teams and Network.
This is because I'm limited to what is available in their current api.
However I have been talking to the guys at Coderwall and I know they
have plans to add a lot more functionality that myself and other guys
working with the api will be able to take advantage of.</p>

<h2>
