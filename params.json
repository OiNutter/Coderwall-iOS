{"name":"Coderwall-iOS","tagline":"iOS app for Coderwall.com","body":"Coderwall-iOS\r\n=============\r\n\r\n![iPhone Screenshots](https://github.com/OiNutter/Coderwall-iOS/raw/gh-pages/images/iPhones.png)\r\n\r\nThe App\r\n-------\r\n\r\nCoderwall-iOS is an app for iPhone and iPad that lets you browse your\r\n[Coderwall](http://coderwall.com) profile. You can browse you list of\r\nbadges, your accomplishments and your stats and specialities, and even\r\nsearch for other users.\r\n\r\nWhy is it Open Source?\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nI'm putting the app on the App Store for free as it's making use of\r\nCoderwall, a free service, which itself is taking advantage of GitHub,\r\na huge promoter of Open Source, and free for public use, so it seemed\r\nsomewhat against the spirit of the thing to try and charge for it. In\r\naddition it's my first app and is really just a bit of fun. \r\n\r\nAs for why I'm making it available on GitHub, like I said, it was my first app and\r\nwas something of a learning experience. I'm putting it here for 2\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\n* I hope that it will help other people trying to get into iOS\r\n  development, that they'll be able to learn from the things I had to do\r\nto make things work the way I wanted them to.\r\n* I hope that people with more knowledge and experience when it comes to\r\n  iOS and Objective C will maybe get involved, and offer improvements\r\nand tips so I can learn more for future projects.\r\n\r\n### A Note On Copying ###\r\n\r\nI realise the risk with putting this code online is that someone else\r\ncould just take it and publish their own version, they could even charge\r\nfor it. I also realise there's probably not a lot I can do about that\r\nshort of making it private, which I don't want to do. All I can hope to\r\ndo is say if you want to add new features or improvements, please get\r\ninvolved and support this app, submit pull requests and bug reports etc\r\nand lets try and have one really good Coderwall app, instead of several\r\naverage ones.\r\n\r\nComing Soon\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nAt the moment the app is read only and doesn't take advantage of some of\r\nthe new features Coderwall has been adding, such as Teams and Network.\r\nThis is because I'm limited to what is available in their current api.\r\nHowever I have been talking to the guys at Coderwall and I know they\r\nhave plans to add a lot more functionality that myself and other guys\r\nworking with the api will be able to take advantage of.\r\n\r\nLibraries\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe following third party libraries where used in the app:\r\n\r\n* [DejalActivityView](http://www.dejal.com/developer/#dejalactivityview)\r\n* [EgoTableViewPullRefresh](https://github.com/enormego/EGOTableViewPullRefresh)\r\n* [SBJson](http://stig.github.com/json-framework/)\r\n* [SDURLCache](https://github.com/rs/SDURLCache)\r\n\r\nI've also used [App Icon Template\r\n2.0](http://http://appicontemplate.com/) by Michael Flarup at\r\n[Pixelresort](http://pixelresort.com)\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 Will McKenzie\r\nhttp://oinutter.co.uk\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\r\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\r\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\r\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\r\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\r\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\r\nthe following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\r\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\r\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
